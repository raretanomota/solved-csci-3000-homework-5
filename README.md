In this program, you will manage the information of employees in a company. You will read the <strong>employees.txt</strong> file and store every employee information in a class called <strong>Employee</strong>. You will have an array of Employee objects to keep the information of all employees.

The <strong>employees.txt</strong> file may be in <u>different size</u>. The first line of the file shows the number of employees in the file. And the rest of the file contains a single employee information in each line. A sample view of the file is given below:

In your program you will read the first line and learn the number of employees. Then you will dynamically define an “Employee array” using dynamic memory allocation. Each employee has 5 information such as <strong>Employee ID, Employee Name, Department ID, Department Name, </strong>and<strong> Salary</strong>. Each information will be stored in a field in the Employee object. Once your employee array is ready, you will provide following operations to the user in a menu.

<ul>

 <li>Print All Employees

  <ol>

   <li>Print all information of all Employees</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Print By Department
